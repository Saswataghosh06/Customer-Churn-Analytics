# Data Dictionary

**Project:** Customer Churn Intelligence Platform
**Catalog:** `customer_churn_project` (Databricks Unity Catalog)
**Schemas:** `bronze` → `silver` → `gold`
**Last updated:** derived directly from `sources.yml`, `schema.yml`, and the dbt model SQL in the current codebase. No fields below are inferred beyond what is explicitly stated; where the generation logic of a field could not be confirmed from source, it is marked **Unconfirmed** rather than guessed.

## 1. Bronze Layer (Raw / Landed Data)

### 1.1 `bronze.online_retail`
Raw UCI Online Retail transactions ingested from CSV via a Unity Catalog Volume.

| Column | Inferred Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `InvoiceNo` | STRING | Invoice number. Prefixed with `C` for cancellations/returns. |
| `StockCode` | STRING | Product code. |
| `Description` | STRING | Product description. ~0.27% NULL. |
| `Quantity` | INT | Quantity per transaction line. Negative values indicate returns. |
| `InvoiceDate` | STRING | Invoice timestamp, raw format `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm` (source file encoding ISO-8859-1). |
| `UnitPrice` | DOUBLE | Price per unit in GBP. Zero/negative values indicate errors or free items. |
| `CustomerID` | STRING | Unique customer identifier. NULL for ~24.93% of rows — unusable for customer-level analytics. |
| `Country` | STRING | Customer country. United Kingdom accounts for ~91–92% of rows. |

### 1.2 `bronze.customers_simulated`
Customer-level aggregates joined with **synthetic** subscription attributes, used to enable ML feature engineering that the raw UCI dataset does not natively support (the UCI dataset has no subscription or churn label of its own).

| Column | Inferred Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CustomerID` | STRING | Unique customer identifier. |
| `first_purchase_date` | TIMESTAMP | Customer's first transaction date. |
| `last_purchase_date` | TIMESTAMP | Customer's last transaction date. |
| `transaction_count` | INT | Total number of transactions. |
| `total_spend` | DOUBLE | Total lifetime spend. |
| `total_items` | INT | Total items purchased. |
| `unique_products` | INT | Number of unique products purchased. |
| `country` | STRING | Customer country. |
| `recency_days` | INT | Days since last purchase. |
| `tenure_days` | INT | Days between first and last purchase. |
| `subscription_tier` | STRING | **Synthetic** field. One of `Basic`, `Standard`, `Premium`, `Enterprise`. **Unconfirmed:** the exact assignment rule (e.g., percentile-of-spend cut-off vs. random draw) is not present in the available SQL, notebooks, or docs supplied for this project, so it is not stated here as fact. |
| `monthly_fee` | DOUBLE | **Synthetic** field, ≥ 0. **Unconfirmed** generation rule — same caveat as above. |
| `churn_label` | INT (0/1) | **Confirmed** rule (stated directly in `sources.yml`): `1` if the customer has been inactive for more than 90 days, `0` otherwise. |

> **Honesty note:** `subscription_tier` and `monthly_fee` are documented here as synthetic/simulated exactly as the source config describes them. Their precise generation formula was not recoverable from the files provided, so this dictionary states that plainly instead of presenting an invented rule as fact.

## 3. Gold Layer (Business Marts)

## 5. Field-Level Business Rules Reference

| Rule | Where Applied | Exact Logic |
|---|---|---|
| Churn definition | `bronze.customers_simulated` → all downstream marts | `recency_days > 90` ⇒ `churn_label = 1` |
| RFM segment assignment | `mart_customer_segments` | Rule-based on `r_score`/`f_score`/`m_score` thresholds (see model SQL) |
| Whale flag (segments mart) | `mart_customer_segments` | `monetary` ≥ 99th percentile of all customers |
| Whale flag (churn mart) | `mart_churn_risk` | `total_spend` ≥ £50,000 (fixed threshold, not percentile-based — note this differs in method from the segments mart's whale flag) |
| CLV modeling eligibility | `mart_clv_projections` | Excludes customers with `frequency = 0` (one-time buyers) — 4,338 → 4,267 customers modeled (71 excluded) |
